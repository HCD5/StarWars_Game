Description: A space invaders style game with a star wars theme
Outcome: This was the first project I completed while learning python, with the goal of becoming more familiar with the syntax and structure of python by completing a pratical party. This was also the first time I used git for version control, so I learned how to initilize a git repository and some basic commands.
